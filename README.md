# The Artist Locator

The Artist Locator is designed to combine Spotify API and TicketMaster API into one convenient location to allow users to utiltize both at the same time. While looking up your favorite artist, you can search their top 10 songs while seeing if they are to have a concert or any purchasable event in the upcoming months. The interface is simple enough for anyone to freely use without being lost. Enjoy.

## Installation

User can access our repo by downloading a HTTP or SSH key from the provided link below. Once the repo has been cloned to your own repo/computer, user can have full visibility into the code written. Code consists of two HTMLs pages: one for the 'Home' page and another for the produced 'Search' results. Each HTML page has its own CSS and JavaScript code to help separate the different functionalities.

## Usage

Users can navigate to our Artist Locator webpage, and once clicked into, user can search any favorite or interested artist of their choice into the search bar. Once that is done, user will click the search bar for their desired results. Taken into a new page, the left hand side of a table will provide the user the artist's top 10 songs and the right hand side will provide a list of 5 upcoming events the artist may have or be performing in. Each title of song or event is now clickable to either take to the song on Spotify or take the user to TicketMaster to find more details about the event and how to make a purchase.
